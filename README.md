#Vulgar Lab

###`Rated - 18`

You are to create a function that can check and identify if a sentence contain vulgar words

Your Vulgar class (function) instance should contain a function `check()` that returns true when a vulgar word is present in the sentence.
Other instance variable include the following

+ `content`: (_object_) should return the first vulgar word in the sentence as an array
+ `count`: (_number_) should return the length of `content`
+ `original`: (_string_)  should return the original sentence
+ `isVulgar`: (
_boolean_) should return true if the sentence contains a vulgar word


The `fixedSentence()` should return the sentence, replacing the vulgar words with **x_X**



## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\vulgar.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Basic understanding of Regular Expressions is required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
